DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHM
Q 1 - Which of the following usees FIFO method

A - Queue

B - Stack

C - Hash Table

D - Binary Search Tree

Answer : A
Explanation
Queue maintains two pointers − front and rear. In queue data structure, the item inserted first will always be removed first, hence FIFO!

Q 2 - Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree with height k, where root is height 0, is

A - 2k − 1

B - 2k+1 − 1

C - 2k-1 + 1

D - 2k − 1

Answer : B
Explanation
If the root node is at height 0, then a binary tree can have at max 2k+1 − 1 nodes.

For example: a binary tree of height 1, can have maximum 21+1 − 1 = 3 nodes.

   r    --------- 0
  / \
 L   R  --------- 1
Q 3 - Find the odd out

A - Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm

B - Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm

C - Floyd-Warshall's All pair shortest path Algorithm

D - Dijkstra's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm

Answer : C
Explanation
Floyd-Warshall's All pair shortest path Algorithm uses dynamic programming approach. All other mentioned algorithms use greedy programming approach

Q 4 - What is not true about insertion sort?

A - Exhibits the worst case performance when the initial array is sorted in reverse order.

B - Worst case and average case performance is Ο(n2)

C - Can be compared to the way a card player arranges his card from a card deck.

D - None of the above!

Answer : D
Explanation
All given options are true about insertion sort.

Q 5 - Apriory algorithm analysis does not include −

A - Time Complexity

B - Space Complexity

C - Program Complexity

D - None of the above!

Answer : C
Explanation
Algorithms are independent of programming languages, hence, program complexity is not a part of algorithm analysis.

Q 6 - Time required to merge two sorted lists of size m and n, is

A - Ο(m | n)

B - Ο(m + n)

C - Ο(m log n)

D - Ο(n log m)

Answer : B
Explanation
The time required to merge two sorted list is Ο(m + n).

Q 7 - Which of the following uses memoization?

A - Greedy approach

B - Divide and conquer approach

C - Dynamic programming approach

D - None of the above!

Answer : C
Explanation
Remembering the results of previously calculated solutions is called memoization.

Q 8 - In a min heap

A - minimum values are stored.

B - child nodes have less value than parent nodes.

C - parent nodes have less value than child nodes.

D - maximum value is contained by the root node.

Answer : C
Explanation
In a min heap, parent nodes store lesser values than child nodes. The minimum value of the entire heap is stored at root.

Q 9 - The following sorting algorithms maintain two sub-lists, one sorted and one to be sorted −

A - Selection Sort

B - Insertion Sort

C - Merge Sort

D - both A &am; B

Answer : D
Explanation
Both selection sort and insertion sort maintains two sublists and then checks unsorted list for next sorted element.

Q 10 - Project scheduling is an example of

A - greedy programming

B - dynamic programming

C - divide and conquer

D - none of the above.

Answer : B

11) How can we describe an array in the best possible way?

The Array shows a hierarchical structure.
Arrays are immutable.
Container that stores the elements of similar types
The Array is not a data structure
Answer: c

Explanation: The answer is c because array stores the elements in a contiguous block of memory of similar types. Therefore, we can say that array is a container that stores the elements of similar types.

12) Which of the following is the correct way of declaring an array?

int javatpoint[10];
int javatpoint;
javatpoint{20};
array javatpoint[10];
Answer: a

Explanation: The answer is a because int specifies the type of the array, javatpoint is the name of the array, and 10 is the size of the array enclosed within the square brackets.

13) How can we initialize an array in C language?

int arr[2]=(10, 20)
int arr(2)={10, 20}
int arr[2] = {10, 20}
int arr(2) = (10, 20)
Answer: c

Explanation: The answer is c because the values assigned to the array must be enclosed within a curly bracket.

14) Which of the following is the advantage of the array data structure?

Elements of mixed data types can be stored.
Easier to access the elements in an array
Index of the first element starts from 1.
Elements of an array cannot be sorted
Answer: b

Explanation: The answer is b because the elements in an array are stored in a contiguous block of memory, so it is easier to access the elements of an array through indexing.

15) Which of the following highly uses the concept of an array?

Binary Search tree
Caching
Spatial locality
Scheduling of Processes
Answer: c
